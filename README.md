drawmeinDOS
===========

A simple paint application written in Borland Turbo C.


The code was written for old Turbo-C compliers in DOS environment. 
Yes such environments are rare, but you can set it up by 
* Searching for an antique Borland Turbo C complier on modern search engines
* Installing DosBox, you may need windows for this.

The Application was written by Veeresh Beeram & Karthik V Bellur, during their
	sophomore year at NITK in partial fulfillemnt of LAB work. 

The UI design was inspired by the then newly launched Google Chrome. All the
	Paint menus are snugly fitted into top 15 px of the screen, on a 
	horizontal bar running the length of the screen.

This design leaves a huge canvas to draw & experiment.
